# Background

I grew up in Northern Virginia and recieved by B.S. in Microbiology from Virginia Tech in 2023. I currently research *Salmonella* in water, and ask questions like: How does *Salmonella* get into water? How does *Salmonella* move through a creek? How long does *Salmonella* stay in a creek? and What adaptations do different serovars of *Salmonella* use to survive in water?

I have a particular interest in microbial genomics and transcriptomics. I have done some analysis of RNA-seq data, and some genomic analysis from Whole Genome Sequencing.

In this course I hope to learn about tools for processing large data sets and more bioinformatics skills.

One interesting thing about me is that I am well known for my terrible puns. ![Alt text](398CBB43-8970-4BF2-902C-FC664FE8040B.jpeg)

[Tn-seq](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvrh5TYixnU) This is a video about the use of Tn-seq in Rhodobacter that does a good job describing how a Tn-seq dataset is generated. I plan on doing something similar soon for my research in *Salmonella*.
